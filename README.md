## Bill of Materials
**5mm color changing LED** (quantity 1):
* [EDGELEC 100pcs 5mm RGB Slow Flashing LED Diodes Multicolor (White Lens / Colors Changed Automatically) Diffused Round Top +100pcs Resistors (For DC 6-13V) / Bulb Light Emitting Diode](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B077X9Z3FW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

**Resistor** (quantity 1):
* [E-Projects 500EP5141K00 1k Ohm Resistors, 1/4 W, 5% (Pack of 500)](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LWLTQFU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [E-Projects 500EP514470R 470 Ohm Resistors, 1/4 W, 5% (Pack of 500)](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N1QZGL2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* NOTE: Resistor value should be chosen based on personal preference for brightness.  I found the LED to be too bright with 470 Ohm while inside my apartment with indoor lighting.  I preferred to make the LED dimmer with 1K Ohm.

**4 pin connector for the Badge** (quantity 1)
* [Digi-Key Part Number: S7105-ND](https://www.digikey.com/short/jwmcjq)
* Manufacturer Part Number: PPPC022LFBN-RC
* Description: CONN HEADER FMAL 4PS .1" DL GOLD

**2 pin headers for the Add-on board**  (quantity 2)
* [Digi-Key Part Number: 952-2261-ND](https://www.digikey.com/short/jwmcjp)
* Manufacturer Part Number: M20-9990245
* Description: SIL VERTICAL PC TAIL PIN HEADER
* NOTE: it is much cheaper to buy 2 pin headers, use two of these 2 pin headers per Add-on board to yield a 4 pin header.
